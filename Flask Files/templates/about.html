        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Current sports competitions are mostly broadcast in the form of live video or video files, and information
            detection for athletes and sports economic processes can also be carried out through image detection
            technology.</p>
        <p>However, from the current situation, we can see that sports image detection technology is still immature.
            Therefore, this study uses sports image as a material to analyze the application of sports image detection
            technology.</p>
        <p>In this study, image detection technology edge detection, grayscale processing, object capture, target
            recognition, etc. are combined with the actual needs of sports image to achieve a variety of needs for
            sports image detection.</p>
        <p>Simultaneously, this study has realized the recognition of athletes, motion recognition, sports behavior
            judgment, etc. and built a test platform to verify the effectiveness of this research method.</p>
        <p>The results show that the research method has certain practicality and can provide a theoretical reference
            for subsequent related research.</p>
